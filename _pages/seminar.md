## Upcoming Talks 

| Date | Speaker | Title | Abstract |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | -------- | 
| Sep 25 | Cerene Rathilal | On frames and the Peano compactification | <details> This talk will provide an introduction to pointfree topology and have a focus on some recent work on compactifications of frames. In [Curtis (1980): Hyperspaces of Noncompact Metric Spaces], Curtis introduced the concept of a locally non-separating remainder in order to study the hyperspace of a non-compact space $X$. Using the property of a locally non-separating remainder, Curtis established the conditions under which a Peano compactification of a connected space $X$ would exist. In this talk, we will present the analog of the concept of locally non-separating sets, in frames. We will discuss properties of sublocales, after which we define a locally non-separating sublocale and conclude by providing a generalisation for a special case of Curtisâ€™s result. </details> |
