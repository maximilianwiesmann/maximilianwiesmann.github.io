Math Seminar at CSBD
======

This is the website for the Math Seminar at CSBD. Upcoming talks and abstracts are posted here. The seminar, if not announced differently, takes place on *Thursdays at 3pm*. Currently, the organizers are [Nikola Sadovek](https://sites.google.com/view/nikola-sadovek){:target="_blank"}, Maximilian Wiesmann and [Giulio Zucal](https://sites.google.com/view/giulio-zucal/home-page){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to reach out to them if you would like to suggest a speaker or for any organizational questions.

Each talk is scheduled for 50 minutes, with an additional 10 minutes for questions.

*Location:* CSBD ([location on Google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fs93agptKavkdyiG8)), top floor seminar room.


## Upcoming Talks 

| Date | Speaker | Affiliation | Title | Abstract |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | 
| Oct 02 | Sabina Haque | University of Michigan Ann Arbor| Graph-theoretic and algebraic geometric approaches to biochemical reaction networks | <details> Under mass-action kinetics, systems of biochemical reactions are modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), a class of graphs that gives rise to polynomial dynamical systems. Approaches in this field include chemical reaction network theory and the more recent linear framework. In this talk, I will focus primarily on the linear framework, a graph-theoretic approach to timescale separation in biochemical systems. I will discuss a graph-theoretic construction within the framework that mimics what would happen if a single parameter in a graph is taken to infinity, producing what we call an asymptotic graph. I consider how properties of the asymptotic graph, such as its steady states, serve as an appropriate representation for a linear framework graph in this limit. I also speculate on some extensions of this construction beyond the scope of the linear framework to parameter identifiability and the steady state varieties of CRNs, suggesting areas for future work at the intersection of graph theory, algebraic geometry, and dynamical systems. </details> |
| Oct 09 | Edmilson Roque | MPI PKS | Ergodic basis pursuit leads to robust reconstruction of sparse network dynamics | <details> Networks of coupled dynamical systems are successful models in diverse fields of science, ranging from physics to neuroscience. The network interaction structure impacts the dynamics; in fact, many malfunctions are associated with disorders in the network structure. Yet, typically, we cannot measure the interaction structure; we only have access to multivariate time series of nodes’ states. This led to considerable effort in reconstructing the network from multivariate data. This reconstruction problem is ill-posed for large networks, leading to the reconstruction of false network structures. In this talk, I will present an approach that uses the network dynamics’ statistical properties to ensure the exact reconstruction of weakly coupled sparse networks. Moreover, this approach exhibits robustness against noise. I will illustrate its reconstruction power using experimental multivariate time series data obtained from optoelectronic networks. </details> |

| Oct 23 | Oskar Henriksson | MPI CBG | Computing discriminant complements using pseudo-witness sets | <details> A key object for understanding a parametrized polynomial system is the discriminant variety, which divides the parameter space into regions of constant qualitative and quantitative properties of the solution sets. However, a common challenge in the study of discriminant varieties is that many methods rely on having access to explicit equations, which in general requires solving a costly implicitization problem. In this work, we present a new approach for finding sample points in all connected components of the complement of discriminant varieties, which combines the recent Hypersurfaces.jl package with the framework of pseudo-witness sets in a way that allows us to circumvent the need for symbolic elimination. This is joint work in progress with Paul Breiding, John Cobb, Aviva Englander, Nayda Farnsworth, Jon Hauenstein, David Johnson, Jordy Garcia, and Deepak Mundayur. </details> |
| Oct 30 | Lin Wan | Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; ELBE Visiting Faculty of CSBD | Learning Collective Multicellular Dynamics with an Interacting Mean-Field Neural SDE Model | <details> The advent of temporal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has enabled in-depth investigation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous multicellular systems. Despite remarkable advancements in computational methods for modeling cellular dynamics, integrating cell-cell interactions (CCIs) into these models remains a major challenge. This is particularly true when dealing with high-dimensional gene expression profiles from large populations of interacting cells, where the intricate interplay between cells can be obscured by data complexity. In this talk, I will present our recent work on a neural interacting mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework for temporal scRNA-seq data. Our approach combines mean-field modeling with neural networks to learn the dynamics of large, interacting cell populations directly from data. It enables the reconstruction of intrinsic cell population trajectories and the systematic characterization of CCIs. Notably, the model uncovers biologically interpretable, non-reciprocal interaction patterns and offers a principled way to study complex, non-equilibrium multicellular systems. </details> |

## Past Talks


| Date | Speaker | Affiliation | Title | Abstract |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | 
| Sep 25 | Cerene Rathilal | University of Kwa-Zulu Natal | On frames and the Peano compactification | <details> This talk will provide an introduction to pointfree topology and have a focus on some recent work on compactifications of frames. In [Curtis (1980): Hyperspaces of Noncompact Metric Spaces], Curtis introduced the concept of a locally non-separating remainder in order to study the hyperspace of a non-compact space $X$. Using the property of a locally non-separating remainder, Curtis established the conditions under which a Peano compactification of a connected space $X$ would exist. In this talk, we will present the analog of the concept of locally non-separating sets, in frames. We will discuss properties of sublocales, after which we define a locally non-separating sublocale and conclude by providing a generalisation for a special case of Curtis’s result. </details> |
