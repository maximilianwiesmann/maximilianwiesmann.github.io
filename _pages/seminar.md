Math Seminar at CSBD
======

This is the website for the Math Seminar at CSBD. Upcoming talks and abstracts are posted here. The seminar, if not announced differently, takes place on *Thursdays at 3pm*. Currently, the organizers are [Nikola Sadovek](https://sites.google.com/view/nikola-sadovek){:target="_blank"}, Maximilian Wiesmann and [Giulio Zucal](https://sites.google.com/view/giulio-zucal/home-page){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to reach out to them if you would like to suggest a speaker or for any organizational questions.

Each talk is scheduled for 50 minutes, with an additional 10 minutes for questions.


## Upcoming Talks 

| Date | Speaker | Title | Abstract |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | -------- | 
| Sep 25 | Cerene Rathilal | On frames and the Peano compactification | <details> This talk will provide an introduction to pointfree topology and have a focus on some recent work on compactifications of frames. In [Curtis (1980): Hyperspaces of Noncompact Metric Spaces], Curtis introduced the concept of a locally non-separating remainder in order to study the hyperspace of a non-compact space $X$. Using the property of a locally non-separating remainder, Curtis established the conditions under which a Peano compactification of a connected space $X$ would exist. In this talk, we will present the analog of the concept of locally non-separating sets, in frames. We will discuss properties of sublocales, after which we define a locally non-separating sublocale and conclude by providing a generalisation for a special case of Curtisâ€™s result. </details> |
| Oct 02 | Sabina Haque | Graph-theoretic and algebraic geometric approaches to biochemical reaction networks | <details> Under mass-action kinetics, systems of biochemical reactions are modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), a class of graphs that gives rise to polynomial dynamical systems. However, it remains unclear how certain graph operations, which are well-characterized on undirected graphs, can be defined for directed labeled graphs. In this talk, I will focus primarily on the linear framework, a graph-theoretic approach to timescale separation in biochemical systems, and discuss an extension of its mathematical foundations. Here, I introduce a graph-theoretic construction within the framework that mimics what would happen if a single parameter in a graph is taken to infinity, producing what we call an asymptotic graph. We consider, through comparisons of the steady states and the mean first passage time, how an asymptotic graph can serve as an appropriate representation for a linear framework graph in this limit. We also speculate on some extensions of this construction on the steady state varieties of CRNs, suggesting areas for future work at the intersection of graph theory, algebraic geometry, and dynamical systems. </details> |

| Oct 23 | Oskar Henriksson | Computing discriminant complements using pseudo-witness sets | <details> A key object for understanding a parametrized polynomial system is the discriminant variety, which divides the parameter space into regions of constant qualitative and quantitative properties of the solution sets. However, a common challenge in the study of discriminant varieties is that many methods rely on having access to explicit equations, which in general requires solving a costly implicitization problem. In this work, we present a new approach for finding sample points in all connected components of the complement of discriminant varieties, which combines the recent Hypersurfaces.jl package with the framework of pseudo-witness sets in a way that allows us to circumvent the need for symbolic elimination. This is joint work in progress with Paul Breiding, John Cobb, Aviva Englander, Nayda Farnsworth, Jon Hauenstein, David Johnson, Jordy Garcia, and Deepak Mundayur. </details> |
