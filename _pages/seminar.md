| Jan 08 | Andreas Thom | TU Dresden | On planar sections of the dodecahedron | <details> In the analysis of three-dimensional biological microstructures such as organoids, microscopy frequently yields two-dimensional optical sections without access to their orientation. Motivated by the question of whether such random planar sections determine the underlying three-dimensional structure, we investigate a discrete analogue in which the ambient structure is the vertex set of a Platonic solid and the observed data are congruence classes of planar intersections. For the regular dodecahedron with vertex set $V$, we define the planar statistic of a subset $X \subseteq V$ of vertices as the distribution of isometry types of inclusions $\Pi \cap X \subseteq \Pi\cap V\subseteq V$,  </details> |

| **Jan 26** | **Michael Hecht** | University Wrocław, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf | The Fast Newton Transform (FNT) | <details> The FNT is a novel algorithm for multivariate polynomial interpolation with a runtime of nearly Nlog(N), where N scales only sub-exponentially with spatial dimension, surpassing the runtime of the tensorial Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We have proven and demonstrated the optimal geometric approximation rates for a class of analytic functions—termed Bos–Levenberg–Trefethen functions—to be reached by the FNT and to be maintained for the derivatives of the interpolants. This establishes the FNT as a new standard in spectral methods, particularly suitable for high-dimensional, non-periodic PDE problems, interpolation tasks, arising as the computational bottleneck in solving, e.g. 6D Boltzmann, Fokker-Planck, or Vlasov equations, multi-body Hamiltonian systems, and the inference of governing equations in complex self-organizing systems. </details> |

| Dec 11 | Sjoerd Van der Niet | Renyi Institute Budapest, TU Munich | Spectral convergence of Laplacians on dense hypergraph sequences | <details> Higher-order networks have become a popular tool in the network science community to model dynamics such as synchronization and diffusion. The linearized system often depends on a Laplacian operator and its spectral properties. We introduce a Laplacian operator for uniform hypergraphs and study the limiting operator for an increasing sequence of dense uniform hypergraphs using the theory of graph limits. Although a theory of dense hypergraph limits has been developed by Elek and Szegedy, and independently Zhao, not much of its implications to spectral properties is known. We show that a weaker notion of convergence for the sequence of hypergraphs is sufficient to obtain pointwise convergence of the spectrum of the Laplacians. </details> |
| Dec 04 | Timo de Wolff | TU Braunschweig | An Introduction to Nonnegativity and Polynomial Optimization | <details> In science and engineering, we regularly face (constrained) polynomial optimization problems (CPOP). That is the task to minimize a real, multivariate polynomial under polynomial constraints. Solving these problems is essentially equivalent to certifying nonnegativity of real polynomials - a key problem in real algebraic geometry since the 19th century. Since this is a notoriously hard to solve problem (e.g., various NP-complete problems admit a CPOP formulation), one is interested in certificates that imply nonnegativity and are easier to check than nonnegativity itself. In particular, a polynomial is nonnegative if it is a sums of squares (SOS) of other polynomials. Being an SOS can be detected effectively via semidefinite programming (SDP) in practice. In 2014, Iliman and I introduced a new certificate of nonnegativity based on sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials (SONC), which I have developed further since then both in theory and practice joint with different coauthors. Circuit polynomials are a particular type of very sparse polynomial, which allow to decide nonnegativity easily. SONC certificates are interesting both from a theoretical and practical viewpoint, as they are independent of sums of squares and can be computed effectively via relative entropy programs. In this talk, I will give an introduction to polynomial optimization, nonnegativity, and the role of sparsity within these problem ensembles. I will moreover introduce SOS and SONC, and, give some examples of applications of nonnegativity certificatess. </details> |
| Nov 27 | Daniel McGinnis | Princeton University | A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals | <details> We solve a long-standing open problem posed by Goodman and Pollack in 1988 by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal (a $k$-dimensional affine subspace that intersects each set in the family) for any $0 \le k \le d-1$. This result is a common generalization of Helly's theorem ($k=0$) and the Goodman-Pollack-Wenger theorem ($k=d-1$). Our approach is topological and employs a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem on Stiefel manifolds. This is joint work with Nikola Sadovek. </details> |
| Nov 20 | Clemens Brüser | TU Dresden | Smoothness and Determinantal Representations of Adjoint Hypersurfaces | <details> Adjoint polynomials of convex polytopes have recently received attention from the field of particle physics, and the question has been raised whether they admit determinantal representations. In this talk we define the notion of adjoint polynomials/hypersurfaces and characterize them through their degree and a simple vanishing condition. Through this vanishing condition we derive a certificate for the existence of singularities on the adjoint hypersurface. We then survey the classical theory on determinantal representations. We prove that the adjoint curve of a polygon always has a natural symmetric determinantal representation that certifies hyperbolicity. For three-dimensional polytopes we show that if the adjoint is smooth, then a determinantal representation exists. The methods to find these representations are computationally viable. There are also some negative results for higher dimensions. The presented results are based on joint work with Mario Kummer and Dmitrii Pavlov (both TU Dresden) and with Julian Weigert (MPI-MIS Leipzig). </details> |
| Nov 13 | Thomas Bouchet | MPI CBG | An invariant theoretic approach to algebraic curves | <details> In this talk, I will present key tools from invariant theory and show how they can be used for explicit computations with algebraic curves. I will begin by introducing invariants that classify curves of a given genus up to geometric isomorphism. Beyond providing explicit equations for moduli spaces of curves, these invariants play a major role in constructing explicit examples of curves. Then, I will introduce the notion of covariants, and explain how one can reconstruct a curve/hypersurface from its invariants. I will illustrate this process through examples of curves with "interesting properties" obtained in this way. Finally, I will show how covariants can provide an efficient way to compute linear changes of variables between homogeneous polynomials, largely outperforming existing implementations. </details> |
| Nov 06 | Iolo Jones | Durham University | Computing Diffusion Geometry | <details> Calculus and geometry are ubiquitous in the theoretical modelling of scientific phenomena, but have historically been very challenging to apply directly to real data as statistics. Diffusion geometry is a new theory that reformulates classical calculus and geometry in terms of a diffusion process, allowing these theories to generalise beyond manifolds and be computed from data. In this talk, I will describe a new, simple computational framework for diffusion geometry that substantially broadens its practical scope and improves its precision, robustness to noise, and computational complexity. We introduce a range of new computational methods, including all the standard objects from vector calculus and Riemannian geometry, spatial PDEs and vector field flows, and topological features like cohomology, circular coordinates, and Morse theory. These methods are fully data-driven, parameter-free, scalable, and can be computed in near-linear time and space. </details> |
| Oct 30 | Lin Wan | Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; ELBE Visiting Faculty of CSBD | Learning Collective Multicellular Dynamics with an Interacting Mean-Field Neural SDE Model | <details> The advent of temporal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has enabled in-depth investigation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous multicellular systems. Despite remarkable advancements in computational methods for modeling cellular dynamics, integrating cell-cell interactions (CCIs) into these models remains a major challenge. This is particularly true when dealing with high-dimensional gene expression profiles from large populations of interacting cells, where the intricate interplay between cells can be obscured by data complexity. In this talk, I will present our recent work on a neural interacting mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework for temporal scRNA-seq data. Our approach combines mean-field modeling with neural networks to learn the dynamics of large, interacting cell populations directly from data. It enables the reconstruction of intrinsic cell population trajectories and the systematic characterization of CCIs. Notably, the model uncovers biologically interpretable, non-reciprocal interaction patterns and offers a principled way to study complex, non-equilibrium multicellular systems. </details> |
| Oct 23 | Oskar Henriksson | MPI CBG | Exploring the parameter space of polynomial systems using pseudo-witness sets | <details> Polynomial systems that arise in applications are often *parametric* (in the sense that the coefficients depend on some model parameters), and many problems in applied math boils down to understanding what possible geometries the solution sets to such systems can take as the parameters vary. A key tool for studying such questions is the *discriminant variety*, which partitions the parameter space into regions of constant qualitative and quantitative properties of the solutions. A common challenge, however, is that many methods rely on having access to an explicit equation for the discriminant, which generally requires solving a costly elimination problem. In this talk, I will present a new approach for finding sample points in all connected components of the complement of a discriminant variety, which uses pseudo-witness sets to circumvent the need for symbolic elimination. </details> |
| Oct 16 | Renee Hoekzema | Free University of Amsterdam | Spectral gene selection methods and models for host/parasite co-phylogeny | <details>  I will talk about two disjoint projects. Firstly, I will talk about an application of spectral graph theory to the study of single cell transcriptomics, in particular the problem of feature selection of relevant genes in such experiments. Single cell transcriptomics is a powerful technique in biology that allows for the measurement of gene expression levels in many individual cells simultaneously. Current methods for analysis assume that cell types are discrete. However, in practice there is also continuous variation between cells: subtypes of subtypes, differentiation pathways, responses to environment or treatment, et cetera. We propose topologically-inspired data analysis methods that identify coherent gene expression patterns considering discrete and continuous patterns on equal footing. This is joint work with Lewis Marsh, Otto Sumray, Thomas Carroll, Xin Lu, Helen Byrne and Heather Harrington. Secondly, I will talk about ongoing work with Gillian Grindstaff on models for co-evolution of “nested’’ systems, such as parasite/host systems, individuals within a species, or “phylosymbiosis” – the coupled evolution of the microbiome and its hosts. We create a space of nested phylogenetic trees and study its intricate geometry. In particular we show that this space is CAT(0) – in analogy with the influential work of Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) – implying the existence of unique averages over nested trees. </details> |
| Oct 09 | Edmilson Roque | MPI PKS | Ergodic basis pursuit leads to robust reconstruction of sparse network dynamics | <details> Networks of coupled dynamical systems are successful models in diverse fields of science, ranging from physics to neuroscience. The network interaction structure impacts the dynamics; in fact, many malfunctions are associated with disorders in the network structure. Yet, typically, we cannot measure the interaction structure; we only have access to multivariate time series of nodes’ states. This led to considerable effort in reconstructing the network from multivariate data. This reconstruction problem is ill-posed for large networks, leading to the reconstruction of false network structures. In this talk, I will present an approach that uses the network dynamics’ statistical properties to ensure the exact reconstruction of weakly coupled sparse networks. Moreover, this approach exhibits robustness against noise. I will illustrate its reconstruction power using experimental multivariate time series data obtained from optoelectronic networks. </details> |
| Oct 02 | Sabina Haque | University of Michigan Ann Arbor| Graph-theoretic and algebraic geometric approaches to biochemical reaction networks | <details> Under mass-action kinetics, systems of biochemical reactions are modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), a class of graphs that gives rise to polynomial dynamical systems. Approaches in this field include chemical reaction network theory and the more recent linear framework. In this talk, I will focus primarily on the linear framework, a graph-theoretic approach to timescale separation in biochemical systems. I will discuss a graph-theoretic construction within the framework that mimics what would happen if a single parameter in a graph is taken to infinity, producing what we call an asymptotic graph. I consider how properties of the asymptotic graph, such as its steady states, serve as an appropriate representation for a linear framework graph in this limit. I also speculate on some extensions of this construction beyond the scope of the linear framework to parameter identifiability and the steady state varieties of CRNs, suggesting areas for future work at the intersection of graph theory, algebraic geometry, and dynamical systems. </details> |
| Sep 25 | Cerene Rathilal | University of Kwa-Zulu Natal | On frames and the Peano compactification | <details> This talk will provide an introduction to pointfree topology and have a focus on some recent work on compactifications of frames. In [Curtis (1980): Hyperspaces of Noncompact Metric Spaces], Curtis introduced the concept of a locally non-separating remainder in order to study the hyperspace of a non-compact space $X$. Using the property of a locally non-separating remainder, Curtis established the conditions under which a Peano compactification of a connected space $X$ would exist. In this talk, we will present the analog of the concept of locally non-separating sets, in frames. We will discuss properties of sublocales, after which we define a locally non-separating sublocale and conclude by providing a generalisation for a special case of Curtis’s result. </details> |
