My name is Maximilian Wiesmann. I am a mathematician working as an ELBE postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Systems Biology Dresden, Germany.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the Nonlinear Algebra group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisors were [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in applied and computational algebraic geometry and combinatorics. This includes toric geometry, [algebraic statistics](https://www.algebraicstatistics.org){:target="_blank"}, analytic combinatorics and quantum information theory.

During September and October 2023 I have been a visiting student at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Chicago.

If you have software or other data related to your research on nonlinear algebra, please consider submitting your data to the [Nonlinear Algebra Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/nonlinalg/records){:target="_blank"} on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/){:target="_blank"}.
