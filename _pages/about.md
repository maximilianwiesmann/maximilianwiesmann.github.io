My name is Maximilian Wiesmann. I am a first year PhD student at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisor is [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io) and I am part of the Nonlinear Algebra group led by [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/).

My research interests are in Algebraic Geometry and its applications, in particular [Algebraic Statistics](https://www.algebraicstatistics.org) and Quantum Information Theory.
