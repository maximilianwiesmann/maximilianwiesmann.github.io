My name is Maximilian Wiesmann. I am a second year PhD student in the Nonlinear Algebra group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisors are [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in Algebraic Geometry and its applications, in particular Toric Geometry, [Algebraic Statistics](https://www.algebraicstatistics.org){:target="_blank"} and Quantum Information Theory.

During September and October 2023 I have been a visiting student at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Chicago.

I am co-organising the [IMPRS Combo II Workshop](https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/events/series/imprs-combo-ii) on Numerics in Algebra and Analysis, taking place at MPI MiS Leipzig from May 22-24; please register if you're interested!
