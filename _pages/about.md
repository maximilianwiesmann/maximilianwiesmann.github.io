My name is Maximilian Wiesmann. I am a third year PhD student in the Nonlinear Algebra group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisors are [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in Algebraic Geometry and its applications, in particular Toric Geometry, [Algebraic Statistics](https://www.algebraicstatistics.org){:target="_blank"} and Quantum Information Theory.

During September and October 2023 I have been a visiting student at the [Institute for Mathematical and Statistical Innovation](https://www.imsi.institute/activities/algebraic-statistics-and-our-changing-world/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Chicago.

I am currently one of the maintainers of [MathRepo](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/index.html){:target="_blank"}, a repository for mathematical research data (code, databases, examples, supplementary material, ...) hosted at MPI MiS and aiming to follow the [Fair Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618){:target="_blank"} for sustainable research.
