My name is Maximilian Wiesmann. I am a first year PhD student in the Nonlinear Algebra group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisors are [Eliana Duarte](https://emduart2.github.io){:target="_blank"} and [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in Algebraic Geometry and its applications, in particular Toric Geometry, [Algebraic Statistics](https://www.algebraicstatistics.org){:target="_blank"} and Quantum Information Theory.
